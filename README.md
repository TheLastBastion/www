This is the [website](https://thelastbastion.github.io/www/) for The Last Bastion. 

# Contributors
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You'll want to read up on that before moving forward. If you want to make a contribution, make a PR for it and make sure you follow the guidelines below.

## Linting
In addition to the Create React App stuff, we also have some fairly strict linting set up. We use eslint (airbnb) and stylelint (stylelint-config-standard).

## Git-flow
We use [Git-flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) which is just a light abstraction around standard git commands. It's fairly easy to learn and will promote semantically correct branching through `features`, `releases`, and `hotfixes`.
